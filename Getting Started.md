### What you need
R3s is meant to be played with *4 people* (1 Game Master and 3 players). Players should have a way to digitally or physically track character progression with *a character sheet*, while the GM will need a way to track environment and cult progression with a *situation sheet*. R3s uses a dice system for combat and roleplay checks. You will need *2 d8's and 2 d6's*. Finally, a way to *map grids* while managing combat. 

# Player Start

## Character Creation
The mechanical aspects of this process are designed to help create a framework for the narrative meat of your character. These mechanics have an impact on how your character will perform, but do not have any bearing on the classes, roles, or behaviors they may take up. The *character sheet* will have places for all the necessary mechanical and narrative selections. 

## 1 - Species

| Species    | Size   | Trait                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Modifiers                                                     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Human      | Medium | *Systemophile* - While interacting with any technological or industrial system, you can either make a {MIND} roll to intuit the purpose of it OR gain +4 Perception when evaluating it.                             | +1 to BODY and SPIRIT /// +2 to one BODY skill and Operation  |
| Deepfolk   | Large  | *Sacred Struggle* - If you fail a contested MIND or SPIRIT check, you can either deal {BODY} physical damage to the perpetrator OR learn one thing about the perpetrator.                                           | +1 to BODY and MIND /// +2 to Athleticism and one MIND skill  |
| Nightgaunt | Small  | *Polymorphism* - Once per day, you may alter your physiology in one of the following ways:<br>- Change Face<br>- Grow Wings<br>- Grow Tail<br>These effects wear off after failing a check in which they were used. | +1 to MIND and SPIRIT /// +2 to Awareness and one WEIRD skill |
After selecting your character's species, you will have 4 Attribute points to distribute between BODY, MIND, SPIRIT, and WEIRD. You can choose to reduce the attribute points granted by your selected species for additional points here. After you finalize your attribute scores, you get skill points equal to the total value of each category to distribute to each skill category. (For example, a total of 4 BODY points gives you 4 BODY skill points. These skill points can be used for any skills in that category.

## 2 - Background
After selecting your character's species, you will need to determine their background. These backgrounds are loosely specified archetypes, and your character may have had any number of causes for the lifestyle they led prior to their recruitment into the Volkus Initiative. 

`Acolyte`
- The Acolyte hails from a life given over to a religious discipline, though they may not follow that same path now. Years as an ardent follower of one faith or another has sharpened the mind and spirit. 
- +2 to Concentration, Cryptography, Awareness, and Esotericism
- Granted Trait - **Faith Alone**: Once per campaign for each choice, operative can call upon their faith and miraculously do one of the following: 
	- Dodge Death: Automatically avoid damage that would kill them.
	- Cleanse Evil: Automatically reset Corruption Threshold to 0. 
	- Surpass Limit: Automatically reduce Stamina Threshold costs to 0 for an encounter. 
`Artisan`
- The Artisan has dedicated much of their life up to this point to a specific craft or discipline, utilizing their hands and body to create things. The nuanced physicality and finesse necessary for such endeavors has equipped them with the understanding and ability to turn trash into treasure.
- +3 to Operation and Crafting
- Granted Trait: **One Man's Trash...**: While crafting an object, operative can substitute a Tier 2 or lower component by rifling through the trash. 
`Colonist`
- The Colonist has traveled great distances to start a new life, perhaps more than once. Adaptable, capable, and hardy, these frontierspeople rarely feel like strangers in any environment. 
- +2 to Endurance, First Aid, Crafting, and Localization
- Granted Trait - **Ain't My First Rodeo**: Adds +10 to all Thresholds.
`Criminal`
- The Criminal has led a life that has in one way or another, put them at odds with the law. The nature of their crimes is of little interest to the Initiative, but the subtle or brazen skillset that has accompanied them is not one to be easily overlooked.
- +2 to Melee/OR/Accuracy, Concealment/OR/Operation, Deception/OR/Intimidation, and Localization
- Granted Trait - **I Know a Guy**: Once per campaign, operative can successfully locate a Criminal Contact without needing to make a check. 
`Detective`
- The Detective has spent some time snooping around and following trails. Either for official law enforcement, as a private investigator, or just for the sake of being too damn curious, the Detective has acquired skills that give them a notable edge with sticking their nose to the ground and in places it sometimes doesn't belong. 
- +2 to Perception, Tracking, Localization, and Persuasion 
- Granted Trait - **Just One More Thing...**: After succeeding a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion check, operative can coax out a piece of information from the target without needing another check. This can only be done once per target. 
`Dealer`

- +2 to Awareness, Empathy, Deception, and Persuasion
- Granted Trait - **Deal's a Steal**: When trading, operative can make a Deception or Persuasion check, reducing an item's price by up to 50%. 
`Escapee`
- Maybe it was prison, maybe it was debtors, maybe it was conscription, or maybe it was even a top-secret science lab. Whatever that place was, the Escapee has been fleeing from it like hell is on their heels. A life on the run has made them into a slippery and highly adaptive individual. 
- +2 to Reflex, Concealment, Awareness/OR/Localization, and one WEIRD Skill. 
- Granted Trait - **Bat Out of Hell**: Once per day, operative can automatically disengage from combat or break pursuit. 
`Grunt`
- The Grunt has made a life out of the least glamorous work. Slinging bullets or fists, shit or stone, they are a sweat (and sometimes blood) stained blue collar, through and through. 
- +2 to Athleticism, Endurance, Accuracy/OR/Melee, and Intimidation
- Granted Trait - **Percussive Persuasion**: In lieu of an Operation or Persuasion check, operative can use their Athleticism to apply "kinetic force" to an object or person to get it to comply. This can trigger combat in some situations.
`Scientist`
- The Scientist has had a (mostly) respectable journey of academics and education. Life in the field of technical inquiry has equipped them with a mental tool set prime for deconstructing a variety of things in the pursuit of understanding. 
- +2 to Perception, Operation, Cryptography, and Awareness
- Granted Trait - **Field of Study**: Operative can perform research on an object without needing to return to the Safehouse. This can only be done outside of combat. 
`Listless`
- The Listless is an enigma. Wanderer, vagrant, or otherwise untethered to any place or culture, the life they've led has put them on the fringes of society. Entirely unbound from any specific path or discipline, there's no path that the Listless can't find their way onto. 
- +2 to any four Skills.
- Granted Trait - **Unbounded Potential**: Choose any Trait granted by another background. 
`Prodigy`
- The Prodigy was identified as a natural Psion very early in their life. What followed was a disciplined upbringing within a scientific or spiritual environment where their skills became the forefront of their everyday life. 
- +2 to Concentration, Esotericism, and any two WEIRD Skills. 
- Granted Trait - **Abysswalker**: Operative begins campaign at 20% Corruption Threshold (TARNISHED) and cannot lower CT below that. Operative is immune to the UNREALIZED status. 
## 3 - Character Specialization
The VI categorizes its operatives based on "Specialization". These specializations dictate the training and equipment available to operatives, while also indicating the mechanical role they play within their team. 

### Spearhead
`The Spearhead is the first one through the door. Shock, awe, and a hail of bullets or blades. These operatives enter combat with an explosive wake, leaving trails of bodies and broken doors in their path.` 

In an operational capacity, Spearheads move quickly and violently through engagements, delivering widespread, disorienting damage in short bursts. 

Training Bonuses:
- +4 to Accuracy OR Melee /// +2 to Accuracy AND Melee
- +3 to Athleticism and Endurance
- +2 to Reflex, Perception, and Intimidation

### Panopticon
`It sees all, hears all, knows all. No wall is safe, no corner unlit, and no mind untouched. These operatives specialize in total awareness, guiding their team into a perfectly choreographed ensemble of devestation.`

Panopticons most commonly hail from individuals who value control and information. In the field, they are intelligence aggregators, using a variety of peripheral tools to gather real-time and predictive information to relay to their team. Panopticons usually use both physical and non-physical means of observation to obtain a multi-layered awareness of their environments. 

Training Bonuses:
- +4 to Perception OR Awareness /// +2 to Perception AND Awareness
- +3 to Reflex and Tracking
- +2 to Localization, Cryptography, and Centering

### Sparkplug
`Instead of bullets and blades, the Sparkplug's tools of war are wires and current. The flick of a switch is this operatives trigger pull, coordinating technical hardware to do their dirty work from a distance.`

Sparkplugs are mechanical maestros, often arising from the ranks of the technically (or otherwise) obsessive. Sparkplugs demonstrate their utility in and out of combat through the use of advanced equipment. From controlling environments to gaining access to remote offensives, the applicability of these operatives' skills is only limited by the tools in their hands the creativity attached to them. 

Training Bonuses: 
- +4 to Operation OR Crafting /// +2 to Operation AND Crafting
- +3 to Cryptography and Perception
- +2 to Reflex, Concentration, and Esotericism

### Warden
`"Shepherd the flock of [God] that is among you, exercising oversight, willingness, and eagerness." -- Transalted excerpt from Old Terran holy text. These operatives are the defenders of their team, becoming a protective bulwark between them and threats.`

These operatives utilize highly defensive postures, outfitting with the heaviest of armor and loudest of clarions. They specialize in not only soaking up damage, but also prioritizing themselves as targets at the same time. 

Training Bonuses:
- +4 to Athleticism OR Endurance /// +2 to Athleticism AND Endurance
- +3 to Melee and Concentration
- +2 to Persuasion, Empathy, and First Aid

### Nomad
`Every step strengthens the foot. Having seen countless different horizons, the strange becomes ordinary and the stranger becomes common. These operatives blend seamlessly into every environment the enter and find friends in the deepest slums or highest skyscrapers.`

These operatives pack light and travel lighter, utilizing skills in resource acquisition to outfit on fly. While combat is not often their forte, they still provide critical support in navigating societies of all kinds. These operatives specialize in social skills and navigation, using their diverse training to adapt rapidly to any situation. 

Training Bonuses:
- +4 to Localization OR Tracking /// +2 to Localization AND Tracking
- +3 to Esotericism and Empathy
- +2 to Intimidation, Persuasion, and Deception

### Wyrd
`Fight fire with fire. In secret, shadowed sublevels, the Initiative prepares a different kind of fighter. Strange transmutations of the body and mind create operatives that wield otherworldly power, often at a cost.`

These operatives undergo ethically questionable training and augmentation to become foci of the very same otherworldly powers the Initiative seeks to fight against. Often forgoing equipment entirely, Wyrds are more than capable of delivering havoc to engagements with little more than their minds. Like Sparkplugs, these tools are not limited to combat, but prove their worth in a wide spectrum of application. 

Wyrds are subject to augmentation that permanently gives them the TARNISHED status. 
Training Bonuses:
- +4 to Evocation
- +3 to one other WEIRD Skill /// +1 to three other WEIRD Skills
- +2 to Empathy, Awareness, and Concentration

### Psion
`The cutting edge. Psionic warfare is among the Initiative's most advanced tecchniques, representing a dual threat of combat efficieny and social manipulation.`

In contrast to the Wyrds, Psions are a much more stable variation of the non-physical operative. Similarly eschewing full kits, Psions use their unique ability to manipulate minds in order to sway combat and conversation in their favor. 

Training Bonuses:
- +4 to Concentration OR Esotericism /// +2 to Concentration AND Esotericism
- +3 to Reflex and Empathy
- +2 to Localization, Perception, and Centering

### Shade
`Without a sound, without a trace. Death walks silently, visiting with no forewarning. Shades move like specters, operating below enemy attention and finding their way into places they shouldn't be with alarming ease.`

Training Bonuses:
- +4 to Concealment OR Deception /// +2 to Concealment AND Deception
- +3 to Reflex and Awareness
- +2 to Perception, Concentration, and Cryptography

## 4 - Equipment
The VI outfits its operatives with a selection of weapons and tools. This equipment is standard issue, and while it meets operational requirements, operatives are encouraged to procure more advanced tools in the field. Additionally, as your team progresses, you will be able to requisition more advanced equipment through your VIC. 

Equipment is categorized into a tier system, reflecting both the rarity and effectiveness of equipment pieces. Furthermore, some equipment requires specific training to use, indicated by the Specialization tag associated with the item. 

Operatives have several specific equipment slots. These are Primary, Secondary, Tool, Deployable, and Armor. When beginning a Campaign, operatives may fill their equipment slots with any Tier I items. 

# Game Master / VIC Start
As both the Game Master and VIC, you are in charge of the narrative and mechanical progression of the Campaign. This is primarily done through the Strife Level and Situation Sheet. To begin a campaign, a number of selections should be made to create the setting and story. Much of the narrative meat in this process is left up to you, but there are number of

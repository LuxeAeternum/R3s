The Volkus Initiative is composed by two parts. The first half is an unparalleled academic institute dedicated to understanding, harnessing, and containing the anomalies that litter the Core World and its colonies. This half is staffed by the most prestigious (and eccentric) minds that populate the wide spectrum of industries within the Human, Deepfolk, and Nightgaunt societies. The second half is a now-clandestine paramilitary organization, which is perpetually pitted in shadowy wars against the otherworldly forces that make up the Outer Court. From the Core World and out to the loneliest of deep space colonies, the Initiative very selectively recruits operatives whose abilities and personalities make them optimal warfighters, effective researchers, and elevated mystics. 
As an R3s operative, you are among this caste of warrior-scientist-mystics. Because of your abilities and past, the Initiative has recruited you into one of several roles. These roles are complimentary to each other, each providing a unique purpose and selection of tools to comprise an effective strike team. 

## Spearhead
`The Spearhead is the first one through the door. Shock, awe, and a hail of bullets or blades. These operatives enter combat with an explosive wake, leaving trails of bodies and broken doors in their path.` 

In an operational capacity, Spearheads move quickly and violently through engagements, delivering widespread, disorienting damage in short bursts.

## Panopticon
`It sees all, hears all, knows all. No wall is safe, no corner unlit, and no mind untouched. These operatives specialize in total awareness, guiding their team into a perfectly choreographed ensemble of devestation.`

Panopticons most commonly hail from individuals who value control and information. In the field, they are intelligence aggregators, using a variety of peripheral tools to gather real-time and predictive information to relay to their team. Panopticons usually use both physical and non-physical means of observation to obtain a multi-layered awareness of their environments.

## Sparkplug
`Instead of bullets and blades, the Sparkplug's tools of war are wires and current. The flick of a switch is this operatives trigger pull, coordinating technical hardware to do their dirty work from a distance.`

Sparkplugs are mechanical maestros, often arising from the ranks of the technically (or otherwise) obsessive. Sparkplug's demonstrate their utility in and out of combat through the use of advanced equipment. From controlling environments to gaining access to remote offensives, the applicability of these operatives' skills is only limited by the tools in their hands the creativity attached to them. 

Training Bonuses:

## Warden
`"Shepherd the flock of [God] that is among you, exercising oversight, willingness, and eagerness." -- Transalted excerpt from Old Earth holy text. These operatives are the defenders of their team, becoming a protective bulwark between them and threats.`

Wardens are a class of guardians, largely comprised of individuals who selflessly defend others and put themselves on the line for the teams' wellbeing. To this end, these operatives utilize highly defensive postures, outfitting with the heaviest of armor and loudest of clarions. They specialize in not only soaking up damage, but also prioritizing themselves as targets at the same time. 

Training Bonuses:
- +4 to Athleticism OR Endurance /// +2 to Athleticism AND Endurance
- +3 to Melee and Concentration
- +2 to Persuasion, Empathy, and First Aid
Starting Kit:

## Nomad
`Every step strengthens the foot. Having seen countless different horizons, the strange becomes ordinary and the stranger becomes common. These operatives blend seamlessly into every environment the enter and find friends in the deepest slums or highest skyscrapers.`

Nomads hail from transients and travelers, people who zealously seek out the new and unknown for sole sake of experience. These operatives pack light and travel lighter, utilizing skills in resource acquisition to outfit on fly. While combat is not often their forte, they still provide critical support in navigating societies of all kinds. These operatives specialize in social skills and navigation, using their diverse training to adapt rapidly to any situation. 

Training Bonuses:
- +4 to Localization OR Tracking /// +2 to Localization AND Tracking
- +3 to Esotericism and Empathy
- +2 to Intimidation, Persuasion, and Deception
Starting Kit:

## Wyrd
`Fight fire with fire. In secret, shadowed sublevels, the Initiative prepares a different kind of warfighter. Strange transmutations of the body and mind create operatives that wield otherworldly power, often at a cost.`

These operatives undergo ethically questionable training and augmentation to become foci of the very same otherworldly powers the Initiative seeks to fight against. Often forgoing equipment entirely, Wyrds are more than capable of delivering havoc to engagements with little more than their minds. Like Sparkplugs, these tools are not limited to combat, but prove their worth in a wide spectrum of application. 

Wyrds are subject to augmentation that permanently gives them the TARNISHED status. 
Training Bonuses:
- +4 to Evocation
- +3 to one other WEIRD Skill /// +1 to three other WEIRD Skills
- +2 to Empathy, Awareness, and Concentration
Starting Kit:
- 

## Psion
`The cutting edge. Psionic warfare is among the Initiative's most advanced tecchniques, representing a dual threat of combat efficieny and social manipulation.`

In contrast to the Wyrds, Psions are a much more stable variation of the non-physical operative. Most Psions are eccentric, outgoing empaths that revel in high-intensity interactions. Similarly eschewing full kits, Psions use their unique ability to manipulate minds in order to sway combat and conversation in their favor. 

Training Bonuses:
- +4 to Concentration OR Esotericism /// +2 to Concentration AND Esotericism
- +3 to Reflex and Empathy
- +2 to Localization, Perception, and Centering

## Shade
`Without a sound, without a trace. Death walks silently, visiting with no forewarning. Shades move like specters, operating below enemy attention and finding their way into places they shouldn't be with alarming ease.`

Training Bonuses:
- +4 to Concealment OR Deception /// +2 to Concealment AND Deception
- +3 to Reflex and Awareness
- +2 to Perception, Concentration, and Cryptography
Starting Kit:
- 

## Silver
`Sweet talker, seductress, and salesman. The Silver fights with words more than weapons.`

## Thresholds
Thresholds are reflective of the physical, mental, and psychical conditions of an entity. When a threshold is reached or surpassed, the entity receives a status. There are multiple scales of thresholds, each with an associated status. These statuses increase in severity to reflect the increasing duress an entity is experiencing. All entities have at least one threshold, but almost all living organisms have three primary scales to manage. 

Threshold scale values are determined by an entity's attributes. Threshold is calculated by the percentage of points an entity has accumulated for a specific scale. 

Points are added to a scale by offensive actions, environmental factors, or abilities. Points can be removed from a scale by support actions, equipment, and abilities. 

### Health Threshold
The Health Threshold (HT) represents the physical state of an entity. Taking damage or being effected by environmental factors will add to HT. HT can be decreased through Support Actions or Equipment. All physical entities have HT. 
`Health Threshold Calculation = FORTITUDE + COOL + 10`
- 0% = NO STATUS (Undamaged, perfectly healthy.)
- 50% = INJURED (Has received considerable physical damage. Reduces amount/efficacy of certain actions)
- 80% = CRITICALLY WOUNDED (Approaching Death's Door. Prevents most offensive actions and limits movement.)
- 100% = PHYSICAL DEATH (The body is rendered inoperable. Restricts all actions in physical space. If an entity has no Psionic abilities, the entity is destroyed.)

### Stamina Threshold
The Stamina Threshold (ST) represents the mental and physical endurance of an entity. Actions that affect movement or use Body Skills will increase ST, while certain Support Actions or Equipment will decrease it. All living entities have ST. 
`Stamina Threshold Calculation = DEXTERITY + WILL + 10`
- 0% = NO STATUS (Rested and focused, completely energized.)
- 70% = TIRED (Has expended most of their energy, begins to feel effects of fatigue. Reduces efficacy of certain actions.)
- 100% = EXHAUSTED (Completely fatigued. Reduces available actions and movement. Actions that add to ST past this point are instead added to HT.)

### Psionics Threshold
The Psionics Threshold (PT) represents the psychical constitution of an entity. Using Psionic abilities or being affected by Psionic effects will increase or decrease PT. All Player Characters and NPCs have PT. 
`Psionics Threshold Calculation = INTELLIGENCE + EROS + 8`
- 0% = NO STATUS (Near meditative balance. Full spectrum of abilities and awareness are available.)
- 25% = INSPIRITED (Flow state of psionic ability. Modifiers of psionic actions are maximized.)
- 75% = STRAINED (Experiencing duress/fatigue. Modifiers of psionic actions are minimized.)
- 100% = PSYCHOSIS (The mind is reduced to tatters. All actions and targets are randomized until PT is reduced below 100%.)
### Corruption Threshold
The Corruption Threshold (CT) represents how close an entity is to losing itself to the weirding energies of the Noosphere. Using certain Psionic abilities, encountering certain creatures or environments, or making certain choices during Investigations will increase CT. CT can only be reset by interacting with the VIC at the Safehouse. However, some CT statuses are beneficial, so balancing this scale is important for operational optimization. All Player Characters have CT. 
`Corruption Threshold Calculation = FOCUS + THANATOS + 8`
- 0% = NO STATUS (Free from Noosphere influence. Take reduced damage from psionic sources.)
- 20% = TARNISHED (Has been touched by forces beyond this world. Non-physical entities become partially perceivable, gains access to WEIRD Skills, and gains one WEIRD action.)
- 50% = STAINED (Fully altered by outside powers. Non-physical entities become fully perceivable, gains one additional WEIRD action.)
- 80% = WARPED (The Outer Court has taken notice, blessing and cursing in the same stroke. Gains one more WEIRD action, gains a Weirded Augment in a random slot, gains HUNTED status.) 
- 100% = UNREALIZED (Corruption takes full hold. Entity is pulled through the fabric of reality and returns as a servant of the Outer Court. If a Player Character is returned this way, they are consider a Boss Enemy and must be defeated and resurrected to reset their CT.)
Whenever a Player Character gains a Corruption Status, they immediately gain a Skill point for any WEIRD Skill.

# Attributes
Attributes are untrained qualities of a character, which are used to calculate threshold scales and applying modifiers. Attributes are determined during character creation, and can only be increased through Augments or Leveling Up. 

There are 8 Attributes, all of which start at 0 and scale up to 8. During character creation, players are allotted 8 points to increase Attributes, up to an initial maximum of 4. Attributes can be further increased later on by acquiring and installing Augment or by reaching higher levels. 

| BODY      | MIND         | SPIRIT | WEIRD    |
| --------- | ------------ | ------ | -------- |
| Fortitude | Focus        | Cool   | Eros     |
| Dexterity | Intelligence | Will   | Thanatos |

# Skills
Skills represent the aptitudes that are developed through training and experience. Skills are used for Skill Checks, meeting Equipment criteria, and applying modifiers. There are four categories of Skill which correspond with the Attribute categories of BODY, MIND, SPIRIT, and WEIRD. Skills are increased by increasing Attributes, Training, and Leveling Up. 

Whenever points are allocated to an Attribute, the same number of points can be added to skills in the same category (Ex: Adding 2 points to Fortitude will grant 2 BODY Skill points). During character creation, players will select a number of Training courses prior to their first deployment. These Training courses apply points to specific groups of Skills based on the type of Training. Finally, certain traits can be selected during a Level Up which will increase specific Skills. 

| BODY        | MIND           | SPIRIT       | WEIRD**        |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Athleticism | Perception     | Localization | Schizoanalysis |
| Endurance   | Concentration* | Deception    | Premonition    |
| Reflex      | Tracking       | Persuasion   | Evocation*     |
| Melee*      | Concealment    | Intimidation | Invocation     |
| Accuracy*   | Cryptography   | Empathy      | Anchoring      |
| First Aid   | Operation      | Awareness    | Mutagenesis    |
| Centering   | Crafting       | Esotericism* | Phobia         |
\* - Combat skills, also used to determine combat modifiers. 
\** - WEIRD Skills are only usable when a character has the TARNISHED status or greater. 

The application of skills is designed to be significantly open ended.

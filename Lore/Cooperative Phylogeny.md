As more and more species were cataloged by the CWU, the old system of root-based phylogeny became increasingly obsolete. A new method of ecological mapping was needed. Researchers quickly learned that convergent evolution was common between different planetary phylogenetic trees. Species from different planets displayed common traits reached through unique evolutionary paths, and so the traditionally perceived "Tree of Life" became much more like a "Web".
